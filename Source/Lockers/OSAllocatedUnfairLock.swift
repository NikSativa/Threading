/// A high-performance, low-level mutual exclusion primitive based on the systemâ€™s unfair lock.
///
/// Use `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` when you need fast, low-level synchronization in performance-critical,
/// low-contention scenarios. This lock is non-recursive and does not guarantee fairness or reentrancy.
///
/// The system manages the allocation and lifecycle of the underlying unfair lock.
///
/// > Important: Do not use in recursive or high-contention locking scenarios.
///
/// ### Characteristics
/// - Minimal overhead and memory usage
/// - Non-recursive (reentrant locking causes deadlock)
/// - No fairness guarantees
/// - System-managed memory lifecycle
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let lock = OSAllocatedUnfairLock()
/// lock.lock()
/// defer { lock.unlock() }
/// // Critical section
/// ```
